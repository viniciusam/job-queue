This is a simple job queue app, implemented using Node.js and AngularJS.

### Running It
```
    npm install
    npm start
```

It will create a web server that listens on port 3000. You can acces it on:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

The npm start command uses a tool called nodemon, that reloads the server every time a file is changed. This is useful for development purposes.
